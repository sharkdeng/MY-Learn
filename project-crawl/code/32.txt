1) The Canadian Institute for Neutron Scattering will be holding the eleventh neutron summer school at Chalk River on May 8th â€“ 13th, 2011.
2) For more information, see the Canadian Institute for Neutron Scattering's Neutron Summer School.
3) The theory will be presented in a way that should be understood by people in any of these fields.
4) The aim of the school is to cover a wide range of topics associated with thermal neutron scattering, including powder diffraction, stress analysis, texture, reflectometry, and small-angle neutron scattering together with the underlying theory associated with neutron scattering.
