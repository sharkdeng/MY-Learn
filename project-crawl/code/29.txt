1) A reaction that needs some type of energy to make it go is said to be endothermic. It takes in energy.
2) When it is mixed with water in your mouth, an endothermic reaction occurs, taking heat energy from your mouth and making it feel cooler.
3) Another example of an endothermic reaction is seen with the cold packs used by athletes to treat injuries. These packs usually consist of a plastic bag containing ammonium nitrate dissolves in the water.
4) This process is endothermic â€“ taking heat energy from the surroundings and cooling the injured part of your body. In this way, the cold pack acts as an ice pack.
